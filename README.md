# robotOS: push-to-talk firmware for the Rabbit R1

Turns a Rabbit R1 into a single-purpose push-to-talk terminal for an AI. Hold the side button and
talk; on release, it either sends what you said or types it into the text field:

- **Keyboard closed:** speech-to-speech. Your voice streams to OpenAI's `gpt-live-1`, which answers in
  voice (about a second after you let go) and hands real thinking, plus web search, to `gpt-6.1-sol`.
  The text appears on screen too. The voice session opens as soon as the screen wakes and closes when it
  goes dark; OpenAI bills it by the second while it's open (about $0.05 a minute).
- **Keyboard open:** dictation. Your words appear in the text field as you speak
  (`gpt-live-transcribe`), dimmed until you let go, and nothing is sent, so you can edit first.
  A tap of the button sends it; `gpt-6.1-sol` answers and the reply is read aloud (`gpt-4o-mini-tts`).

The backends are ChatGPT (an OpenAI API key, the default), **Hermes Agent**, or any
other OpenAI-compatible server.

With **Hermes Agent**, the R1 is a remote for your agent: every push-to-talk turn goes to Hermes as
said, Hermes texts people through the R1 with its `robotos` MCP tools, and texts from your own number
to the R1 go to Hermes, which texts back. Plugged in, the radios stay up so it is always reachable.
See [docs/HERMES.md](docs/HERMES.md).

robotOS was previously called R1 PTT. Its repository is
[windoze95/robotOS](https://github.com/windoze95/robotOS). The Android package (`dev.r1ptt`),
Magisk module ID (`r1ptt_system`), and existing configuration and build filenames retain their
compatibility names.

> **Status: running on a real R1** (LineageOS 21 on Rabbit's September 2026 kernel). The side button,
> speech-to-speech voice turns and live dictation are verified on the device (final text ~0.4 s after
> release). Typed replies are built but not yet tried on it, and standby battery drain hasn't been
> measured ([docs/BATTERY.md](docs/BATTERY.md)).
>
> The current reliability changes add offline-tested transport/capture limits, interruption isolation and
> encrypted-save recovery. Its current-build hardware acceptance is pending; the observations above
> describe the earlier device-tested implementation. See [docs/RELIABILITY.md](docs/RELIABILITY.md).

## What "firmware" means here

The R1 is an Android 13 phone underneath (MediaTek MT6765). The firmware is four layers:

| Layer | What |
|---|---|
| Kernel + vendor | Rabbit's own, kept from the R1's last OTA (the side button only works with Rabbit's kernel). |
| System | LineageOS 21 (Android 14) GSI, with Rabbit's apps removed and the bloat disabled. |
| Root + tweaks | Magisk, plus the `r1ptt-system` module: button and wheel remaps, Rabbit's USB keyboard/mouse mode off, no scanning/location/Bluetooth, faster Doze. |
| App | robotOS (`dev.r1ptt`): the launcher, push-to-talk service, speech, chat and power policy. |

## Using it

| Button | Keyboard closed | Keyboard open |
|---|---|---|
| **Hold** | Talk; release to send. The reply streams and is spoken. | Dictate; release to insert at the cursor. |
| **Tap** | Screen off. When speaking, stop. (A tap on a dark screen just wakes it.) | Send the typed text. |
| **Double-tap** | New conversation. | — |
| **Scroll wheel** | Volume (always). | Volume. |

Tap the text field on the touchscreen to bring up the keyboard. The gear icon opens settings.

The message icon opens **Messages**, a one-to-one SMS handler. With **Hermes Agent** as the backend,
Hermes does the texting (above) and the assistant described here stays out of the way. Otherwise, type
a draft, or opt in to dictation and assistant requests such as “Tell Sam I’m on my way” or “Send a text
to NUMBER.” Numbers can be spoken digit by digit, and a US SIM adds the +1. Saved names resolve
locally (“my mom” finds a saved “Mom”); unknown or ambiguous recipients need your input. With **assistant SMS sending** enabled,
explicit completed commands send directly without review. The assistant writes a natural message
from your intent, or a short greeting when no message is supplied. Say “Text Sam exactly: MESSAGE”
for verbatim wording. Manual drafts still use **Review text**
and **Send SMS**. Sending, new incoming texts, and assistant commands each have
explicit controls in Messages → Options. No SMS permission is requested merely by opening it. Options can request Android’s default SMS
role. MMS is explicitly unsupported; incoming MMS notices are retained locally and shown as warnings.
Message details exposes native failure codes without retrying a failed or uncertain attempt.
With assistant sending enabled, voice uses completed transcription and the selected chat provider
to interpret every completed request and compose messages before sending. When a request can't be carried out, a reply on
Home says why (recipient not matched, not a direct request, unclear exact wording) and is spoken when voice replies and the
network are available. Only the generic explanation is kept
in the conversation; the intercepted SMS request stays out of chat history.
Options → **Recent assistant outcomes** distinguishes missing request details from unresolved saved
recipients and retains brief result categories, including failures; it contains no message text or
recipient numbers.
MMS, RCS, old inbox import, and live carrier acceptance are not included. See [docs/MESSAGES.md](docs/MESSAGES.md).

**Settings → Hermes** (also Messages → Options → Hermes) shows whether Hermes can reach the R1,
how many texts it has sent today, and turns texting Hermes from your own number on or off. The
earlier [Hermes SMS relay](docs/RELAY.md) is retired.

## Battery

Idle time is where a 1000 mAh battery goes.

- **The cellular modem is off by default** (airplane mode with Wi-Fi left on). With **Use cellular
  data (SIM)** enabled, it wakes with the device and returns to airplane mode at the normal idle cut.
- **Wi-Fi switches off** after 3 minutes with the screen dark. The next button press turns it back
  on, and it reconnects while you're still talking.
- **Plugged in, the radios stay up.** On any external power the idle cut is skipped, so incoming texts
  and Hermes reach the R1 anytime. Unplugged, the normal cut applies again.
- **No continuous background polling in pocket mode:**
  - no polling, scanning, location or Bluetooth;
  - Rabbit's apps are removed;
  - Doze starts within seconds.
  - Optional incoming SMS use Android broadcasts while the modem is reachable. Messages does not
    keep it awake; carrier-queued delivery after wake is not guaranteed.
- **The screen stays on only during a turn**, then times out after 15 s at low brightness.
- **The network is used only when there's work:** a turn (voice streams only while you hold the
  button, and the live session closes 20 s after a reply), a text to Hermes, or a request from Hermes.

[docs/BATTERY.md](docs/BATTERY.md) covers the design and how to measure the idle drain.
[docs/ACCEPTANCE.md](docs/ACCEPTANCE.md) defines current-build latency, interruption, reconnect,
service-restart and overnight standby checks. Hardware and acoustic acceptance remain pending;
the read-only capture and offline analyzer include synthetic fixtures, not hardware results.

## Getting started

1. **Try the backend from your Mac first:**
   ```sh
   cp tools/r1ptt.example.json tools/r1ptt.json   # add your OpenAI API key
   tools/smoke-test.sh --play
   ```
2. **Follow [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md):** unlock (Rabbit's developer mode) → stock baseline →
   LineageOS GSI → Magisk → `tools/provision.sh --config tools/r1ptt.json`.

To make Hermes the agent, follow [docs/HERMES.md](docs/HERMES.md) (background in
[server/hermes.md](server/hermes.md)); for self-hosted speech, see [server/speaches.md](server/speaches.md).

## Repo layout

```

Build: `tools/build.sh` (JDK 17+ and the Android SDK; writes `out/r1ptt.apk` and
`out/r1ptt-system.zip`).
Tests: `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` and `python3 -m unittest server.robotos_mcp.tests.test_robotos_mcp`.

App updates: **Settings → App updates** checks for signed APK releases when requested. The
release workflow is disabled until signing continuity and owner-controlled bootstrap are set up.
See [docs/UPDATES.md](docs/UPDATES.md) for release tags, secure signing setup, the first device
installation, Android confirmation and recovery. It updates the app only; hardware acceptance
of the updater remains pending.
