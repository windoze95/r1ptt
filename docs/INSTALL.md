# Installing r1ptt on a stock R1

This takes about an hour of hands-on time once Rabbit has approved developer mode.

**Know the risks before you start:**
- Unlocking permanently voids the R1's warranty.
- A bad flash on a MediaTek device can leave it unbootable. Rabbit's flash tool can always put
  stock rabbitOS back.

## What you need

- A Mac with this repo, plus:
  - `adb` and `fastboot` (`brew install android-platform-tools`)
  - `jq`
  - `uv` (for `tools/fastboot-entry.py`)
  - Google Chrome (for Rabbit's flash tool)
- A USB-C data cable.
- An OpenAI API key, or an OpenClaw or Hermes server (see `server/`).
- Downloads, all saved into `firmware/` (git-ignores it):
  - **Stock rabbitOS v0.8.293**: `rabbit_OS_v0.8.293.zip` from
    https://github.com/rabbit-hmi-oss/firmware/releases. Unzip it to `firmware/stock/`.
  - **LineageOS 21 GSI**: `lineage-21.0-YYYYMMDD-UNOFFICIAL-arm64_bvN.img.gz` from
    https://sourceforge.net/projects/andyyan-gsi/files/ (folder `lineage-21-pre-qpr2-td`; the
    vanilla `arm64_bvN` file, not `bgN`, `a64` or `vndklite`).
  - **Magisk**: `Magisk-v30.x.apk` from https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases.

## 0. Check the backend from your Mac

```sh
cp tools/r1ptt.example.json tools/r1ptt.json      # put your OpenAI key in; delete the providers you don't use
tools/build.sh                                     # builds out/r1ptt.apk and out/r1ptt-system.zip
tools/smoke-test.sh --play                         # speech-to-text, chat, memory, text-to-speech
```

If the smoke test fails, fix the config before touching the R1. For example, if the model name is
rejected, change `providers.openai.model`.

## 1. Developer mode and bootloader unlock (Rabbit's official route)

1. In OS3, go to **settings → r1**. Developer mode only appears once the R1 is linked to your
   account. Type the warranty acknowledgment, enter the R1's IMEI (on the R1: settings → about), and
   click **void warranty and enable developer mode**. Each R1 needs its own request.
2. With the R1 on and online, go to **settings → r1 → device modification** and choose **unlock**.
   This isn't an OTA: Rabbit's servers only switch on the R1's permission to be unlocked. Nothing is
   unlocked yet.
3. Enter fastboot mode with the R1 powered off. You can use either route:
   - **Chrome:** open https://rabbit-hmi-oss.github.io/flashing/ and click "Enter Fastboot Mode".
     Plug the R1 in, and select "MT65xx Preloader" within about 1.5 seconds.
   - **Terminal:** run `uv run --with pyserial tools/fastboot-entry.py`, then plug the R1 in.
4. Check that the permission arrived: `fastboot flashing get_unlock_ability` should print `1`.
   - If it prints `0`, reboot the R1 (`fastboot reboot`), let it sit online for a minute, and repeat
     step 2.
5. Run `fastboot flashing unlock`. **This wipes the R1.** If it asks for confirmation, confirm with
   the side button.
6. `fastboot getvar unlocked` should now say `yes`.

Optional, but cheap insurance: back up the partitions that hold the IMEI and radio calibration.
Nothing in this guide writes to them, but MediaTek devices are notorious for losing them.

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/bkerler/mtkclient     # needs libusb: brew install libusb
mtk r nvram,nvdata,nvcfg,protect1,protect2,proinfo nvram.bin,nvdata.bin,nvcfg.bin,protect1.bin,protect2.bin,proinfo.bin
```

## 2. Stock baseline (usually skip it)

Skip this on an R1 that is simply up to date. `tools/flash-gsi.sh` keeps Rabbit's current kernel and
vendor, on whichever slot the R1 boots from, and those already match its bootloader. That's how the
first R1 was done (2026-10-03, Rabbit kernel from September 2026).

Flash the v0.8.293 baseline only if the R1 is in an unknown or broken state. Use either route:
- **Rabbit's flash tool → Flash Stock ROM.** It writes the full matching set, then **locks the
  bootloader again**, so run `fastboot flashing unlock` once more afterwards.
- **Command line:** with the R1 in fastboot, run `tools/flash-baseline.sh firmware/stock`. This leaves the
  bootloader chain alone, so on an R1 that has taken OTAs it pairs newer firmware with the older kernel.

## 3. LineageOS GSI

```sh
uv run --with pyserial tools/fastboot-entry.py     # then plug in the powered-off R1
tools/flash-gsi.sh firmware/lineage-21.0-*-arm64_bvN.img.gz firmware/stock
```

The stock folder only supplies the vbmeta and empty-userdata images. The script:
- turns verified boot off;
- wipes data the way Rabbit's restore does;
- removes Rabbit's `product` partition (its launcher and services) on the active slot;
- writes the GSI to the active slot's `system` and reboots.

The first boot takes a couple of minutes. The LineageOS GSI is a userdebug build with adb open, so
`adb devices` should list the R1 right away. Go through setup on the R1 and connect to Wi-Fi. If
everything is too big to tap, run `adb shell wm density 190`.

## 4. Root with Magisk

```sh
tools/root.sh
```

The script does this without any tapping on the R1:
- installs the Magisk app;
- copies the R1's own current boot image off over `adb root`;
- patches it with Magisk's own script, on the R1;
- flashes it to the active slot and reboots.

The unpatched image is kept in `out/`; flash it back with `tools/flash-boot.sh` to unroot.
Magisk shows "additional setup" until `provision.sh` finishes its file setup in the next step.

## 5. Provision

```sh
tools/provision.sh --config tools/r1ptt.json
```

The script makes these changes:
- Finishes Magisk's setup, and installs the Magisk module (button and wheel remaps, power defaults).
- Installs the app with its permissions.
- Grants the app root.
- Makes the app the home screen.
- Turns the lock screen off.
- Sets a 15 s screen timeout and low brightness.
- Disables the bloat in `tools/debloat.txt`.
- Pushes your config, including API keys.
- Reboots.

It's safe to re-run, e.g. after editing the config or rebuilding. `--undo-debloat` re-enables the
disabled apps.

## 6. Check that it works

Work through these with the R1 on USB:

1. **Voice, keyboard closed.** Hold the button, ask something, let go. It should start answering
   in voice about a second later, with the text on screen. The screen turns off about 15 s after it
   finishes.
2. **A follow-up** within 20 seconds keeps the context. A web question ("weather in …") shows
   "Searching the web…" while `gpt-6.1-sol` looks it up.
3. **The press that wakes the screen.** Let the screen go off and wait a minute (or run
   `adb shell dumpsys deviceidle force-idle`). Then hold the button and speak right away: nothing
   you said should be lost.
4. **Dictation.** Tap the text field so the keyboard opens. Hold, speak and release: the text lands
   at the cursor and nothing is sent. A tap of the button sends it, and the reply is read aloud.
5. **Taps.** A tap with the screen on turns it off. A tap while it's talking stops it. A double-tap
   shows "New conversation".
6. **Scroll wheel.** It changes the volume (a slider appears), in any screen state.
7. **Wi-Fi cut.** After 10 minutes with the screen off, `adb shell cmd wifi status` shows Wi-Fi
   disabled. The next hold shows "Connecting to Wi-Fi…" and then works. `tools/wifi-wake-test.sh`
   times how long that reconnect takes.
8. **Battery.** Unplug the R1 overnight, then plug it in and run `tools/battery-report.sh`. See
   [BATTERY.md](BATTERY.md).

## Troubleshooting

**The button does nothing.**
1. Check that the app's root reader is up: `adb logcat -s r1ptt` should show "side button reader
   up on /dev/input/eventN".
2. Run `adb shell su -c cat /proc/bus/input/devices`. The button should be listed as `mtk-kpd`; if
   it has another name, set `"buttonDevice"` in the config.
3. Run `adb shell dumpsys input | grep -A4 mtk-kpd`. `KeyLayoutFile` should be our `mtk-kpd.kl`.
   The module's own log is `/data/adb/modules/r1ptt_system/service.log`.

**It boot-loops after installing the module.**
There are no volume keys, so Magisk's safe-mode combo is unavailable. Instead, while it loops, run:
```sh
adb wait-for-device shell magisk --remove-modules
```

**Back to stock.** Use Rabbit's flash tool → Flash Stock ROM. It works from any state that can
still reach the preloader.

**Mic or speech errors.** The status line shows the server's reason. "Bad API key" means fix the
key and re-run provision with `--config`.
