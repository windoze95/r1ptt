# Battery

The R1 has a 1000 mAh battery (about 3.8 Wh). For battery life, what matters is how little the
device draws while it sits idle; how long each conversation takes matters much less. Some rough
arithmetic:

- **Screen-on time:** 30 conversations a day at about 20 s each is about 10 minutes of screen at
  low brightness. That costs roughly 1–2% of the battery.
- **Idle draw:** an idle current of just 10 mA costs 24% a day. At 3 mA it's about 7% a day.

So the work goes into making idle as close to "everything off" as possible.

## What r1ptt does

| Drain | Approach |
|---|---|
| Cellular modem | Kept off permanently (airplane mode set up to leave Wi-Fi alone). `power.cellular: true` turns it back on if a SIM is in. |
| Wi-Fi | Off after `power.wifiIdleMinutes` (default 3) with the screen dark; on again at the next press or screen-on. Reconnecting takes about 1.2 s on the R1 (`tools/wifi-wake-test.sh`), overlapping your speaking; if it ever takes longer, the screen shows "Connecting to Wi-Fi…" and your words are buffered, not lost. |
| Bluetooth, location, scanning | Off: no Wi-Fi or BLE "always scanning", no Wi-Fi auto-wakeup, no network recommendations. |
| Background apps | Rabbit's product partition is removed and LineageOS extras are disabled (`tools/debloat.txt`). The app itself has no timers, polling or open connections while idle. |
| Doze | Enters light idle immediately and deep idle about 30 s after screen-off (module `service.sh`). |
| Screen | On only while a turn is active, then a 15 s timeout at brightness 60/255. No ambient display or lift/tap-to-wake. |
| Button | Read by a root `dd` blocked on the input device: zero CPU until a press. The kernel's key interrupt wakes the SoC. |
| Network per turn | Voice turns (speech-to-speech) stream raw 24 kHz audio only while you hold the button, plus the spoken reply. The session opens when the screen wakes (so it's ready by the time you talk) and closes at screen-off or 20 s after an exchange; set `live.warm: false` to connect only on a hold. Dictation uploads compressed AAC (about 4 KB per second of talking), and transcription, chat and speech share one HTTP/2 connection. |
| CPU per turn | No on-device speech models; the cloud (or your server) does the heavy work. |

## Measuring

The app logs battery level at every screen on/off. Those logs bracket the idle periods without
waking the device to take samples.

1. Charge the R1, then unplug it. USB keeps it awake and charging, which would hide the drain.
2. Use it normally, or just leave it overnight.
3. Plug it in and run `tools/battery-report.sh`. It reports:
   - idle drain per hour, counted only over unplugged screen-off periods of 30 minutes or more;
   - successful and failed suspends (counts that never move mean the SoC never reached deep
     sleep);
   - Android's screen-on and screen-off discharge;
   - the top kernel and app wakelocks.

For a quick look on the device, go to Settings (gear icon) → Battery.

## Results

To be filled in on hardware. These targets are first guesses, to be adjusted after measuring:

| Setup | Target idle drain | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Wi-Fi cut after 3 min (default) | < 0.5 %/h | |
| Wi-Fi always on (`wifiIdleMinutes: 0`) | < 1.5 %/h | |
| Cellular on (`cellular: true`) | — | |

## If idle drain is high

- **`suspend_stats` success never increases:** something is holding a wakelock. Look at the
  report's kernel wakelock list. On GSIs this is often a vendor service that doesn't match the
  system.
  - If it can't be fixed, fall back to rooted stock rabbitOS. Its kernel, vendor and system match;
    the same module and app work there.
- **Wi-Fi drains even when idle:** lower `wifiIdleMinutes` to 1.
- **Drain only after using it:** check that the screen actually turns off (screen timeout in
  `power.screenTimeoutSec`) and that nothing holds `r1ptt:turn` (`dumpsys power | grep r1ptt`).
